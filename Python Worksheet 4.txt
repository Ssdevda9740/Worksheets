11.(a) Interpreter translates just one statement of the program at a time into machine code.   Compiler scans the entire program and translates the whole of it into
                                                                                                  machine code at once.

(b) An interpreter takes very less time to analyze the source code. However, the overall         A compiler takes a lot of time to analyze the source code. However, 
    time to execute the process is much slower.                                                  the overall time taken to execute the process is much faster.

(c) An interpreter does not generate an intermediary code. Hence, an interpreter is highly      A compiler always generates an intermediary object code. It will need 
    efficient in terms of its memory.                                                           further linking. Hence more memory is needed.

(d) Keeps translating the program continuously till the first error is confronted. If any      A compiler generates the error message only after it scans the 
error is spotted, it stops working and hence debugging becomes easy.                           complete program and hence debugging is relatively harder while working with a compiler.

(e) Interpreters are used by programming languages like Ruby and Python for example.           Compliers are used by programming languages like C and C++ for example.

Ans12. PYTHONPATH is an environment variable which you can set to add additional directories where python will look for modules and packages. For most installations,
 you should not set these variables since they are not needed for Python to run. Python knows where to find its standard library.
The only reason to set PYTHONPATH is to maintain directories of custom Python libraries that you do not want to install in the global default location (i.e., the
 site-packages directory).

13. Python provides three methods that can be used to trim whitespaces from the string object.

strip(): returns a new string after removing any leading and trailing whitespaces including tabs (\t).
rstrip(): returns a new string with trailing whitespace removed. It’s easier to remember as removing white spaces from “right” side of the string.
lstrip(): returns a new string with leading whitespace removed, or removing whitespaces from the “left” side of the string.


s1 = '  abc  '

print(f'String =\'{s1}\'')

print(f'After Removing Leading Whitespaces String =\'{s1.lstrip()}\'')

print(f'After Removing Trailing Whitespaces String =\'{s1.rstrip()}\'')

print(f'After Trimming Whitespaces String =\'{s1.strip()}\'')

OUTPUT-


String ='  abc  '
After Removing Leading Whitespaces String ='abc  '
After Removing Trailing Whitespaces String ='  abc'
After Trimming Whitespaces String ='abc'
